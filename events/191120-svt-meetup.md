# Event intro
Welcome to another Stockholm React Meetup at SVT!

For this event we are borrowing a studio from Sveriges Radio, we'll greet you at the main entrance of Radiohuset. Since the event takes place after working hours, please bring a photo id.

There are approximately 100 seats this time and RSVP will open 13th of November at 12:00. 

As the event will take place in a professional studio we will record the talks and make them available at SVT Play. See this as a great opportunity for you to practice your presentation skills in front of a large audience. 
Please let us know here on Meetup.com and let's make it happen!
