**Title:** How we used non-linear storytelling to create a scalable user onboarding

**Description:** Insurance is complicated, to onboard a customer we need to ask various questions that in turn might lead to more questions. This lead us on a path to build a scalable web and app-onboarding solution inspired by non-linear storytelling.

**Title:** Legacy coding without going insane

**Description:** Browsing up and down files of crappy code that someone who doesn’t work here anymore wrote a long time ago, that turned into legacy, sucks. But it’s something that most of us just have to live with. However we can choose to tackle it in different ways. This talk will present some strategies for how to (hopefully) not break things - or worse - lose your mind completely.
