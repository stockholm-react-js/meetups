# Your event intro
This is a bit of a special event where we don't really have speakers etc but rather will try to get together to learn about hooks by doing some programming in small groups.

So, as most of you probably know, hooks: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html is a sort of new concept in React and has quite a big impact on how to structure and think about building certain functionality.

I myself feel as if I haven't really had time to dig into, and experiment with hooks which is why an event such as this was created.

The basic event structure is as follows:

We meet at the Universal Avenue office at 18:00, once there we will listen to a lightning talk from Magnus Helmersson, a frontend developer at Universal Avenue who will talk about hooks and what can be done with them.
After that we will start hacking away and exploring hooks together in small groups, at the end of the evening we will all hopefully have had some time to explore and will have learned a thing or two together.

Because of the different setup of this event the seats are quite limited, we think we can fit a maximum of 30 people or so.

We will make sure that there are snacks and drinks on hand so we can focus on the programming and learning together.

If this works and and we think it's fun we will make sure to keep doing events like this in the future.
