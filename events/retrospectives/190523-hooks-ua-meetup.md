## What went well?
- I thought Magnus did an amazing job with the presentations and excercicses.
- There was enough seats for everyone.
- People seemed to talk to each other in the groups they were sitting in.

## What could be improved?
- The pizza was pretty sad, unclear why, ordered from a pretty good place.
- People removed their RSVP at the last second so was very hard to understand how many
people would show up which also lead to not enough people showing up.
- Perhaps this event required too much preparations? Might be easier to just have a standing
event where anyone who wants to meets up at some hotel lounge and hacks on things together.
