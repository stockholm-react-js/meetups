**Description:** Building websites today has become quite complex and a lot of it has to do with all the tooling and hosting solutions that need to be in place. Static site generators, such as Gatsby, have come to fill a void where simplicity is key. So why not use it? At Hedvig, we used to build our website with Gatsby, but we decided to move away from it for several reasons. This is the story about how and why.
